                  To sign in to our website, users need to choose an
                  organization they belong to. This selection is essential for
                  access control, data security, and providing a personalized
                  user experience. Users can belong to multiple organizations,
                  and they need to indicate which side of the website
                  (organization) they want to access during the login process.
                  This ensures that users can access specific data, features,
                  and workflows relevant to each organization they are
                  affiliated with. The process streamlines login, enhances
                  security, and tailors the user experience to the needs of
                  individual organizations.
